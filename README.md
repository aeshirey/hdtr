# HDTR
`hdtr` is both a compiled binary and a Rust crate to generate "high-dynamic _time_ range" images from a set of input photos. Inspiration for this project came from [Martin Krzywinski's High Dynamic Time Range Photography - Visualizing the Flow of Time](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/fun/hdtr/) that I stumbled upon years ago.
